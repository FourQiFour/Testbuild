        <h2 class="Goals"> Day 1?</h2>
        <p> So, for this I am going to start a blog type thing and use it
            as a way to document my journey. Today 1/22/22 is the day I delved into
            studying that <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/21915914#questions"> udemy
                course </a> on web dev I
            bought a bit ago
        </p>
        <p> As I learn new code I will update this page occasionally. Sort of like a progress tracker
        </p>

        <section id="Goals">
            <h3 class="Top"> Goals</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Be proficient in front end web skills</li>
                <li> Learn basic blockchain dev</li>
                <li> Create something valuable</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p id="info-el"> </p>
            <button onclick="logData()" class="Abme "> About me here </button>
        </section>


        <div class="TIL">
            <h2> <a id="Things">Things I like</a></h2>

            <p> So Firstly I would like to add things I like to this page as to
                keep the personal aspect of it up. Here is a picture of a tiger (picture needs to be scaled down, it
                will be
                done with CSS): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Lo5DPXgHE" target="_blank"><img class="Tiger"
                        src="https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/CEEJYohg9VZAqlqB4WEg0wTz4LA=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TAU2JU73A5HNVJO7IPO5J3XJOU.jpg"></a>

            <p> Now that I have a semi functional website, I will gladly be listing things I Like below in no
                particular
                order </p>
            <section>
                <div class="SW">
                    <p class="SWtxt"> STAR WARS</p>
                </div>

            </section>


        </div>
        </p>
        <section class="Prog">
            <h2 id="PT">
                Progress Tracker
            </h2>
            <p> Im not quite sure how to save versions of this project however I will save different files at 9 day
                intervals to see where it goes. So, this project will be advancements with Day 1-9 and detailing
                what I
                have
                learned
                All this I am aware of already Paragraphs, adding images, anchor tags, semantics, all that, and some
                basic
                CSS. However, the CSS will not be added yet.
                I have also found that I could add multiple Days and not take up much space in my computer, so I
                will be
                doing that.
                Here is a link to one of the new attributes I am starting named<a href="table.html"> table </a>
                Next, I will be making a <a href="forms.html"> form </a> this is day 2 1/24/22. The google form will
                not
                have the interactivity of JS
                but it will certainly be visually appealing, "visually appealing"
                Update: I added the CSS to the tiger. I added a hover effect, a different color theme, and a
                background
                image to the title. I would like to maybe add a menu, just cause it would be fun.
                1/27/22</p>
            <h2 class="date"> 1/25/22</h2>
            <p> Today has mostly been playing around with the forms, its taken up majority of the time. I should be
                able to move on to css by tomorrow</p>

            <p>Completed the html pathway with final obstacle being this <a href="Race.html"> form</a> it did not
                take me too long but it was sort of repetetive and ended up stuck on one page. It doesnt go anywhere
                useful because I
                am not quite sure how to do that. I could only make it return to the main page since it is not finished.
                Tomorrow I will be start ing CSS and the week after that JS and hopefully move on to solidity.</p>
            <h2 class="date"> 1/26/22 </h2>
            <div>
                <p> So, today I learned CSS. Rather Refreshed my existing knowledge on CSS. The website is still very
                    basic
                    but it
                    is
                    inproving slowly. I hope to add text directly to the page with time, I haven't learned that yet.
                    I
                    have
                    also shrunk the image of the tiger which is exciting. I am not looking to center it which I
                    believe
                    can
                    be done if I insert it in to its own line. </p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="31"> 1/31/22 </h2>
            <div>
                <p> These past few days have been primarily messing around with the personal website. Looking into other
                    asepcts of cod, etc. I believe this to be my future career so I will act as so. Better in practice
                    as opposed to school and waste time. Im glad to live in an age that provides with such an
                    oppurtunity</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <h2 class="1"> 2/1/22 </h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I decided to do a deep dive on JS so I can speedrun to React followed by Solidity. So today, I will
                    try adding an increment button to this website
                </p>


            </div>
            <h2 class="TOO"> 2/2/22 </h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Spent some time finally getting that button on this website to work. As of now I just need to spend
                    some more time with JS. I inted to make the button save to the website, which I will learn how to do
                    very soon.
                    The aspect of using it so you dont lose it is becoming prevalent with CSS. I have been able to
                    design to a certain degree but I am far from decently competent with this language. I definitely
                    have the Ideas but lack that fluidity. So I will be spending alot of time googling for now. Today,I
                    also fixed the paragraphs and formatted them correctly. Obviously it was done manually but it was to
                    the best of my knowledge
                </p>


            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="Fifth"> 2/5/22 </h2>
                <p> I have missed a few days of documentation and Have not added a significant amount of improvements to
                    the website. However, I finally got the button to work and have atleast been putting in 2 hours of
                    work everyday. It's not efficient but it is something while mainting interest within my self. I took
                    a few break hours to play the new Dying light and will be charging right back into this </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="13"> 2/13/22 </h2>
                <p> Apparently, I missed almost 8 days of coding according to interaction on my website. However, that
                    is not the truth I have coded about 95% of the days in some way shape or form.
                    I've simply been working on the scrimba java script course. Over the past few days I have not kept
                    up my motivation. I've missed maybe 2 days of proper advancement in my journey. Simply due to the
                    fact that I've felt like I am in the sunken place. today I will add a button that shows the user an
                    about me when clicked
                </p>
